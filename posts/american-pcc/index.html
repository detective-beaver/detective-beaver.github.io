I am talking to my wife about her plans for today and she decides to check her inbox in parallel by refreshing all incoming correspondence. Suddenly, a couple of new emails pop up on the top of the pile and both of which are from the IRCC. She immideately tells me about this and we are tempted to check them out right away!

Taking your fingerprints onto a special FBI form for civil purposes (a.k.a. FD-258). Filling the FD-258 form properly. Requesting a police clearance document from the authorities (FBI in this case) based on the fingerprints file provided and confirmation email. Registration on the eDO Portal Everything is simple and straightforward here. You populate necessary fields, pay your fees (18 USD) and receive a confirmation email with your order number. The latter is very important as it needs to be sent along with the filled FD-258 in the same envelope to the authorities.\nTaking fingerprints This where the things get a bit tricky. According to the requirements from the Federal Agency, rolled impressions should be taken on the latest version of the FD-258 blank, preferably made by a fingerprints professional. Here is an official document that provides some guidance on what is considered to be a legible impression:\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/capturing-legible-fingerprints.pdf\nThis is what Federal Agency itself is stating on their portal:\n- The FBI will process your request upon receipt of your completed fingerprint card in the date order it was received. - Your fingerprints should be placed on a standard fingerprint form (FD-258) commonly used for applicant or law enforcement purposes. The FBI will accept FD-258 fingerprint cards on standard white paper stock. - You must provide a current fingerprint card. Previously processed cards or copies will not be accepted. - Your name and date of birth must be provided on the fingerprint card. - You must include rolled impressions of all 10 fingerprints and impressions of all 10 fingerprints taken at the same time (these are sometimes referred to as plain or flat impressions). If possible, have your fingerprints taken by a fingerprinting technician. This service may be available at a law enforcement agency. - Fingerprints taken with ink or via live scan are acceptable. If your fingerprints are taken via a live scan device, a hard-copy must be generated so the fingerprint card can be mailed to the FBI. - To ensure the most legible prints possible, refer to the Recording Legible Fingerprints page. If fingerprints are not legible, the fingerprint card will be rejected. This could cause delays in processing and could also result in additional fees. After doing some research, I came across two forum threads where people had been discussing their personal experience with the ‘getting your fingers stamped’ mission:\nChemodan.com.ua, RusForum.ca.\nOne group of people suggested contacting the Canadian Embassy in Ukraine as it used to provide such service for a fee back in the middle of 2016. Without any hesitations, I wrote an email but a response was not positive - they don’t provide this service anymore.\nAlso, someone from Moscow (Russia) mentioned in those forums about the IOM/MOM organization that used to offer fingerprints service. Unfortunately, they did not even care to respond to my email so I had to find other options.\nEven before reading all the aforementioned forum threads, I ran the internet search against the “fingerprints FD-258” keyword and results were not convincing enough to give them a call: there were just two businesses in Kyiv but the latest activity on their sites was dated from 2018, although they clearly mentioned in the articles about taking fingerprints on the “FD-258” card.\nAt this point I thought that it is going to be a real issue for our country to find some professional who is experienced enough with the FD-258. To make things worth, even our local police told us they do not want to have anything with the documents they are not used to see and work with which is understandable.\nEventually, I decided to ask at canadakaknado telegram channel and one person from Ukraine responded pointing out to one of the businesses I’d found prior: That was a company we eventually used and the cost was 1000 UAH (cash only). That includes taking your fingerprints on two FD-258 cards and even taking them later again for free in the case where impressions on the FD-258 will be rejected by authorities as not acceptable. You give this company a call in advance, agree on the appointment time slot and they take your fingerprints.\nFilling an FD-258 card Not only the fingerprints should be taken accordingly but an FD-258 form itself has to be filled following official guidelines. From the first glance, having so many weirdly named parameters in this form might seem too hard to comprehend but it is not a rocket science by any means, trust me. In fact, everything is pretty straightforward if you will be using this great document-handbook that contains details along with descriptions for every field:\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/fingerprints_biometrics/guidelines-for-preparation-of-fingerprint-cards-and-association-criminal-history-information\nThis is a list of parameters that we populated. All the rest fields were left as empty.\nName (NAM) block\nConsists from Last, First and Middle Name. Here are the fields that I populated: First Name = John Last Name = Doe Aliases\nMaiden names and all previous married names of females should be entered in the AKA field, if known. Please keep in mind that populating a maiden name is a must for a person that changed a family name after marriage. Date of Birth in the MM/DD/YYYY format Citizenship\nUse the correct abbreviation for foreign countries or correctly spell the name of the country. A list of approved abbreviations can be found in the NCIC Code Manual. “YES” or “NO” responses are not acceptable. For instance, in my case this field can be populated either as Ukraine or UK. Demographic information\nThese are the necessary fields along with sample values. Proper values for RACE, EYES, HAIR can be found from the table listed in the official guidelines document. SEX = M RACE = W (White) HGT. = 510 (5\"10’) WGT. = 176 (80kg) EYES = GRN (GREEN) HAIR = BRO (BROWN) Place of birth\nFormat is similar to the Citizenship field.
