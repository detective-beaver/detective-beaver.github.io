It’s been almost 5 months since we submitted our CEC PR application and got AOR. Time flies and it’s definitely giving us a hard time to overcome all the mental challenges of being apart. A family should be together.

Meanwhile, the Canadian Government has been trying to sort out all the bureaucracy to implement a new set of [border restrictions](https://www.canada.ca/en/transport-canada/news/2021/01/government-of-canada-introduces-further-restrictions-on-international-travel.html?utm_campaign=Weekly%20newsletter%20of%20Detective%20Beaver&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) due to the COVID pandemic.
These should discourage non-essential travel on a new level asking people returning to Canada to pay around 2000 CAD from their pockets for quarantining in the hotels designed by Government, although only God knows when they will be finalized and shared with the public. Until now, not so much information is available online so it’s hard to gain a peace of mind.
