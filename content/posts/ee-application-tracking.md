*John Doe: "Today I logged into my EE profile and saw zero changes after 7 months of wait."*

We got you John Doe - it happended to almost each of us.
Every year Express Entry applicants come accross the fact that it is almost impossible to understand the real state of their express entry application after it was submitted. Here I'll try to list for your all the useful internet resources that can be handy:
1. [MyImmitracker](https://myimmitracker.com)\
Perhaps, the most useful among all available today. It is simply a common database where people can log their applications and any further changes in statuses. Case data is well structured into multiple trackers groupped by Stream (FSW, CEC or PNP) and AOR month. One well recommended feature is its ability to do a prediction based on the data from existing cases. For example, you can put your MED passed date and this site can estimate an approximate date for your PPR.
2. [Canadavisa forum](https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-discussion-board/)\
Pretty self-explanatory - the name speaks for itself. Considers to be a great place to hang out, ask immigration questions and keep your eye on the progress in AOR specific threads.
3. Miscellaneous social groups in the famous social messengers such as Whatsapp, Telegram, Facebook and etc.\
These can be found even on MyImmitracker, Canadavisa and all over the internet. I won't be recommending any particular channel or group as they tend to emerge and dissappear pretty often.

On the top of this, there are some official ways to get a real picture of your application's progress:
1. IRCC Call Centre\
System would allow only people with a Canadian phone number to call in using the following toll-free number: 
```1–888–242–2100```
2. GCMS Notes\
They can be ordered from the IRCC directly or via a third-party agency. If you will decide to use the last one, a special form needs to be filled allowing to share your data.
For immigrants located in Canada the easiest and cheapest way would be to order GCMS notes from the IRCC directly. Outlanders are not allowed to order notes from the IRCC.
