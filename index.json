[{"content":" John Doe: \u0026ldquo;Today I logged into my EE profile and saw zero changes after 7 months of waiting.\u0026quot;\n We got you John Doe - it happended to almost each of us. Every year Express Entry applicants come accross the fact that it is almost impossible to understand the real state of their express entry application after it was submitted. Here I\u0026rsquo;ll try to list for your all the useful internet resources that can be handy:\n MyImmitracker\nPerhaps, the most useful among all available today. It is simply a common database where people can log their applications and any further changes in statuses. Case data is well structured into multiple trackers groupped by Stream (FSW, CEC or PNP) and AOR month. One well recommended feature is its ability to do a prediction based on the data from existing cases. For example, you can put your MED passed date and this site can estimate an approximate date for your PPR. Canadavisa forum\nPretty self-explanatory - the name speaks for itself. Considers to be a great place to hang out, ask immigration questions and keep your eye on the progress in AOR specific threads. Miscellaneous social groups in the famous social messengers such as Whatsapp, Telegram, Facebook and etc.\nThese can be found even on MyImmitracker, Canadavisa and all over the internet. I won\u0026rsquo;t be recommending any particular channel or group as they tend to emerge and dissappear pretty often.  On the top of this, there are some official ways to get a real picture of your application\u0026rsquo;s progress:\n IRCC Call Centre\nSystem would allow only people with a Canadian phone number to call in using the following toll-free number: 1–888–242–2100 GCMS Notes\nThey can be ordered from the IRCC directly or via a third-party agency. If you will decide to use the last one, a special form (IMM5744) needs to be filled. For immigrants located in Canada the easiest and cheapest way would be to order GCMS notes from the IRCC directly. Please keep in mind that outlanders are not permited to order notes from the IRCC. As for the price, it is going to cost you 5 CAD one time fee. According to the ATIP Act, IRCC has 30 days to fulfill a GCMS Notes request which means your notes will contain the information which is 30 days away from the moment you get them.

It’s exciting.\nIt’s been almost 5 months since we submitted our CEC PR application and got AOR. Time flies and it’s definitely giving us a hard time to overcome all the mental challenges of being apart. A family should be together.\nMeanwhile, the Canadian Government has been trying to sort out all the bureaucracy to implement a new set of border restrictions due to the COVID pandemic. These should discourage non-essential travel on a new level asking people returning to Canada to pay around 2000 CAD from their pockets for quarantining in the hotels designed by Government, although only God knows when they will be finalized and shared with the public. Until now, not so much information is available online so it’s hard to gain a peace of mind ☕.\nAlthough some people try their luck by flying to Canada and attempting to land, consequences from breaking the law are simply not worth it - no one wants to loose their well deserved PR.\nNow is simply not a right time to travel: It was one thing when my son crashed my press conference a month or so ago, but this... Now is not the time to travel. Stay home - and by that, I mean your own home. pic.twitter.com/OOUb1tqBZe\n\u0026mdash; Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 23, 2021 ","permalink":"https://detective-beaver.github.io/posts/five-months/","summary":"Posting the first post is like reading the first page of a new book.
