[{"content":"In this post I will share my experience in regards to getting the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) from the USA while being in Ukraine.\nBackground Before we dig into details, a bit of background on why we needed to obtain this document.\nIt was a nice winter day in the middle of February, our application was over 5 months and we had been anxiously waiting for at least any update from the IRCC and you know what it came! I am talking to my wife about her plans for today and she decides to check her inbox in parallel by refreshing all incoming correspondence. Suddenly, a couple of new emails pop up on the top of the pile and both of which are from the IRCC. She immideately tells me about this and we are tempted to check them out right away! Cmon, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while after our MED/BIL update! Tell us already what\u0026rsquo;s there!\nTurns out that both emails have the subject \u0026ldquo;Request letter\u0026rdquo; and asking each of us to provide an FBI clearance certificate. Also, they had a \u0026ldquo;you have resided in the USA for 6 months or more\u0026rdquo; statement inside which we found totally odd - my wife has never been to the USA. Whatever, we thought to ourselves, we are going to apply for it anyways and attach LOE with the explanation describing that she has never been there just in case.\nIt is better safe than sorry!\nProcess overview Express Entry site has clear directions for the USA on how to apply for a PCC document: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates/how/united-states.html There you will find a link pointing to this site that lists all the necessary steps: https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks\nThe whole process involves several things:\n Registration on the https://www.edo.cjis.gov site and paying fees. Taking your fingerprints onto a special FBI form for civil purposes (a.k.a. FD-258). Filling the FD-258 form properly. Requesting a police clearance document from the authorities (FBI in this case) based on the fingerprints file provided and confirmation email.  Registration on the eDO Portal Everything is simple and straightforward here. You populate necessary fields, pay your fees (18 USD) and receive a confirmation email with your order number. The latter is very important as it needs to be sent along with the filled FD-258 in the same envelope to the authorities.\nTaking fingerprints This where the things get a bit tricky. According to the requirements from the Federal Agency, rolled impressions should be taken on the latest version of the FD-258 blank, preferably made by a fingerprints professional. Here is an official document that provides some guidance on what is considered to be a legible impression:\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/capturing-legible-fingerprints.pdf\nThis is what Federal Agency itself is stating on their portal:\n- The FBI will process your request upon receipt of your completed fingerprint card in the date order it was received. - Your fingerprints should be placed on a standard fingerprint form (FD-258) commonly used for applicant or law enforcement purposes. The FBI will accept FD-258 fingerprint cards on standard white paper stock. - You must provide a current fingerprint card. Previously processed cards or copies will not be accepted. - Your name and date of birth must be provided on the fingerprint card. - You must include rolled impressions of all 10 fingerprints and impressions of all 10 fingerprints taken at the same time (these are sometimes referred to as plain or flat impressions). If possible, have your fingerprints taken by a fingerprinting technician. This service may be available at a law enforcement agency. - Fingerprints taken with ink or via live scan are acceptable. If your fingerprints are taken via a live scan device, a hard-copy must be generated so the fingerprint card can be mailed to the FBI. - To ensure the most legible prints possible, refer to the Recording Legible Fingerprints page. If fingerprints are not legible, the fingerprint card will be rejected. This could cause delays in processing and could also result in additional fees.  After doing some research, I came across two forum threads where people had been discussing their personal experience with the \u0026lsquo;getting your fingers stamped\u0026rsquo; mission:\nChemodan.com.ua, RusForum.ca.\nOne group of people suggested contacting the Canadian Embassy in Ukraine as it used to provide such service for a fee back in the middle of 2016. Without any hesitations, I wrote an email but a response was not positive - they don\u0026rsquo;t provide this service anymore.\nAlso, someone from Moscow (Russia) mentioned in those forums about the IOM/MOM organization that used to offer fingerprints service. Unfortunately, they did not even care to respond to my email so I had to find other options.\nEven before reading all the aforementioned forum threads, I ran the internet search against the \u0026ldquo;fingerprints FD-258\u0026rdquo; keyword and results were not convincing enough to give them a call: there were just two businesses in Kyiv but the latest activity on their sites was dated from 2018, although they clearly mentioned in the articles about taking fingerprints on the \u0026ldquo;FD-258\u0026rdquo; card.\nAt this point I thought that it is going to be a real issue for our country to find some professional who is experienced enough with the FD-258. To make things worth, even our local police told us they do not want to have anything with the documents they are not used to see and work with which is understandable.\nEventually, I decided to ask at canadakaknado telegram channel and one person from Ukraine responded pointing out to one of the businesses I\u0026rsquo;d found prior:  if (localStorage.getItem(\"pref-theme\") === \"dark\") { document.write('') } else { document.write('') }  That was a company we eventually used and the cost was 1000 UAH (cash only). That includes taking your fingerprints on two FD-258 cards and even taking them later again for free in the case where impressions on the FD-258 will be rejected by authorities as not acceptable. You give this company a call in advance, agree on the appointment time slot and they take your fingerprints.\nFilling an FD-258 card Not only the fingerprints should be taken accordingly but an FD-258 form itself has to be filled following official guidelines. From the first glance, having so many weirdly named parameters in this form might seem too hard to comprehend but it is not a rocket science by any means, trust me. In fact, everything is pretty straightforward if you will be using this great document-handbook that contains details along with descriptions for every field:\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/fingerprints_biometrics/guidelines-for-preparation-of-fingerprint-cards-and-association-criminal-history-information\n  This is a list of parameters that we populated. All the rest fields were left as empty.\n Name (NAM) block\nConsists from Last, First and Middle Name. Here are the fields that I populated:  First Name = John Last Name = Doe   Aliases\nMaiden names and all previous married names of females should be entered in the AKA field, if known. Please keep in mind that populating a maiden name is a must for a person that changed a family name after marriage. Date of Birth in the MM/DD/YYYY format Citizenship\nUse the correct abbreviation for foreign countries or correctly spell the name of the country. A list of approved abbreviations can be found in the NCIC Code Manual. “YES” or “NO” responses are not acceptable. For instance, in my case this field can be populated either as Ukraine or UK. Demographic information\nThese are the necessary fields along with sample values. Proper values for RACE, EYES, HAIR can be found from the table listed in the official guidelines document.  SEX = M RACE = W (White) HGT. = 510 (5\u0026quot;10') WGT. = 176 (80kg) EYES = GRN (GREEN) HAIR = BRO (BROWN)   Place of birth\nFormat is similar to the Citizenship field. Use the correct abbreviation for foreign countries or correctly spell the name of the country. A list of approved abbreviations can be found in the NCIC Code Manual. Residence of person fingerprinted\nEnter the residential address of the person being fingerprinted. Date you are fingerprinted in the MM/DD/YYYY format Your Signature Signature of person who fingerprinted you  Requesting a Police Clearance Certificate Once you are done with filling the form, a completed fingerprint card along with a copy of your confirmation e-mail has to be mailed to:\nFBI CJIS Division ATTN: ELECTRONIC SUMMARY REQUEST 1000 Custer Hollow Road Clarksburg, West Virginia 26306  We used the DHL service and it cost us 1817 UAH.

Every year Express Entry applicants come accross the fact that it is almost impossible to understand the real state of their express entry application after it was submitted. Here I\u0026rsquo;ll try to list for your all the useful internet resources that can be handy:\n MyImmitracker\nPerhaps, the most useful among all available today. It is simply a common database where people can log their applications and any further changes in statuses. Case data is well structured into multiple trackers groupped by Stream (FSW, CEC or PNP) and AOR month. One well recommended feature is its ability to do a prediction based on the data from existing cases. For example, you can put your MED passed date and this site can estimate an approximate date for your PPR. Canadavisa forum\nPretty self-explanatory - the name speaks for itself. Considers to be a great place to hang out, ask immigration questions and keep your eye on the progress in AOR specific threads. Miscellaneous social groups in the famous social messengers such as Whatsapp, Telegram, Facebook and etc.\nThese can be found even on MyImmitracker, Canadavisa and all over the internet. I won\u0026rsquo;t be recommending any particular channel or group as they tend to emerge and dissappear pretty often.  On the top of this, there are some official ways to get a real picture of your application\u0026rsquo;s progress:\n IRCC Call Centre\nSystem would allow only people with a Canadian phone number to call in using the following toll-free number: 1–888–242–2100 GCMS Notes\nThey can be ordered from the IRCC directly or via a third-party agency. If you will decide to use the last one, a special form (IMM5744) needs to be filled. For immigrants located in Canada the easiest and cheapest way would be to order GCMS notes from the IRCC directly. Please keep in mind that outlanders are not permited to order notes from the IRCC. As for the price, it is going to cost you 5 CAD one time fee. According to the ATIP Act, IRCC has 30 days to fulfill a GCMS Notes request which means your notes will contain the information which is 30 days away from the moment you get them.
